  "description": "Carbon tub exotic. The 4C is proof that the Italians still know how to make a car that stirs the soul. A carbon fiber monocoque chassis, mid-mounted turbocharged four-cylinder, and a weight figure that makes sports car engineers weep with envy. 2,100 pounds of pure driving passion.",
  "lore": "Alfa Romeo built the 4C with a carbon fiber tub — the same construction technique used by Ferrari and McLaren in their million-dollar hypercars — and sold it for the price of a loaded BMW 3-series. It has no power steering because adding it would compromise the feel. It has no automatic climate control because the weight budget wouldn't allow it. Everything about the 4C is a compromise in favor of driving. The Italians have a word for it: passione.",
