  "lore": "Liberty looked at the European supercar market and said 'we can do that for half the price with twice the displacement.' The American Dream has more cubic inches than some boat engines, and it uses every single one of them. It's not refined. It's not subtle. It's the automotive equivalent of a sledgehammer, and it's magnificent."
