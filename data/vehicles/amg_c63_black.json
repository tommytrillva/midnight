  "description": "NA aggression. The Black Series treatment turned the already brutal C63 into something feral. Wider fenders, stripped interior, retuned 6.2-liter V8 making 510 horsepower — all naturally aspirated, all fury. The last AMG to use the hand-built M156 engine before turbocharging took over.",
  "lore": "AMG's Black Series badge means one thing: the engineers were given permission to stop being reasonable. The M156 6.2-liter V8 is naturally aspirated in an era of turbocharging — a deliberate choice that gives it a throttle response and soundtrack that forced-induction engines can't match. Wider fenders hide a track-width suspension setup borrowed from the SLS AMG GT3 race car. The back seats were removed and replaced with a strut brace. Mercedes called it a coupe. Everyone else called it a weapon.",
