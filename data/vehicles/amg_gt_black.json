  "description": "Flat-plane crank AMG. Mercedes took their twin-turbo V8, gave it a flat-plane crankshaft from their GT3 racing program, and bolted on enough aerodynamic hardware to generate 400 kg of downforce. The Black Series is AMG's ultimate statement — a road-legal race car that just happens to have license plates.",
  "lore": "The 'Black Series' badge has always meant AMG's most extreme offering, and the GT Black Series might be the most extreme car they've ever built. The flat-plane crank V8 revs higher and responds faster than the standard cross-plane unit, producing 720 horsepower. The massive rear wing, front splitter, and dive planes generate enough downforce to theoretically drive upside down at speed. It set a 6:43.616 at the Nürburgring — faster than a Porsche 918.",
