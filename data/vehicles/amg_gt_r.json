  "description": "The Green Hell beast. Developed on the Nürburgring Nordschleife — a track the Germans literally call 'The Green Hell' — the AMG GT R is Mercedes' answer to the question nobody asked: what if we made a front-engine car that could humiliate mid-engine supercars?",
  "lore": "AMG's engineers spent hundreds of hours on the Nordschleife refining the GT R's active aerodynamics, rear-wheel steering, and electronically controlled differential. The signature 'AMG Green Hell Magno' paint isn't just a color — it's a warning. This car set a production car lap record at the Nürburgring, and it wants you to know it.",
