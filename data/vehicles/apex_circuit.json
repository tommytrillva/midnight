  "lore": "Zenith's flagship was hand-built by a team of 200 in a dedicated facility. Each engine was assembled by a single technician who signed the valve cover. The Apex Circuit doesn't have the most power in Tier 3, but its mid-engine layout and aluminum construction make it the benchmark for balance. The car that other cars are measured against."
