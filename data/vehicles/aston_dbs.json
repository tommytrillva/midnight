  "description": "A V12 grand tourer with 715 horsepower and the kind of presence that makes valet attendants suddenly remember their manners. The DBS Superleggera is Aston Martin's flagship — brutal power wrapped in bespoke British luxury.",
  "lore": "Superleggera — Italian for 'super light' — is a construction technique Aston Martin borrowed from the coachbuilding era. The carbon fiber body panels drape over an aluminum chassis, keeping weight manageable despite the massive 5.2-liter twin-turbo V12 up front. It's 715 horsepower of refined violence, the kind of car that crosses continents at 200 mph while keeping your champagne properly chilled.",
