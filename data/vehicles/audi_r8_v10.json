  "description": "Everyday supercar. The R8 V10 shares its engine with the Lamborghini Gallardo but wraps it in Audi's understated design and all-wheel-drive confidence. It's the supercar you can drive in the rain, park at the grocery store, and still feel your soul leave your body when you floor it through a tunnel.",
  "lore": "Audi built the R8 because they won Le Mans and needed a halo car to prove it wasn't a fluke. The 5.2-liter V10 sits behind the driver, visible through a glass engine cover, revving to 8,700 RPM with a sound that bounces off parking garage walls like a symphony. Quattro all-wheel drive means it puts the power down in conditions that would leave a rear-drive Italian exotic in a ditch. It's the thinking person's supercar.",
