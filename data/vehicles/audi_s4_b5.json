  "description": "The original biturbo sleeper. The B5 S4 looks like a sensible German sedan your accountant might drive — until you hear the twin turbos spool and watch it launch from a dig with all four wheels clawing at the pavement. The 2.7T V6 responds to tuning like it was begging for more boost all along.",

  "lore": "The B5 S4 community figured out early that bigger turbos, a tune, and supporting mods could push the 2.7T past 400 horsepower reliably. In Nova Pacifica, the B5 S4 is the car that catches you off guard at a roll — you never expect the Audi sedan to pull that hard. That's the whole point.",
