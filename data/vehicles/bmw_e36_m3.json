  "description": "The E36 M3 is the benchmark by which all sport sedans are measured. BMW's S50 inline-6 is silky smooth, the chassis balance is near-perfect, and the car is as comfortable on a canyon road as it is on a race track. It does everything well and nothing poorly.",
  "lore": "The benchmark. When magazine writers run out of ways to describe a car's handling, they say 'it reminds me of the E36 M3.' The cooling system is a ticking time bomb and the subframe mounts are cracking, but the way the straight-six revs to 7,000 makes you forget all of that.",
