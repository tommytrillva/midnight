  "description": "Track-focused M. BMW took the already magnificent E92 M3, stripped out the luxury, bored the S65 V8 to 4.4 liters, bolted on a roll cage, and painted it Fire Orange as a warning. Only 135 were built, and every single one was destined for the circuit.",
  "lore": "The M3 GTS was BMW M division saying 'enough compromise.' They removed the rear seats, fitted polycarbonate windows, added a bolt-in roll cage, and turned up the S65 V8 until it screamed. The result was a street-legal race car that lapped the N\u00fcrburgring in 7:48 — faster than the M5 that cost twice as much. Fire Orange wasn't a color choice. It was a statement.",
