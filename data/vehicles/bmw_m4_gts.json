  "description": "Water injection tech. BMW raided the parts bin from their DTM racing program and built a street-legal M4 with water injection, a roll cage, and lap times that make Porsche owners nervous. Limited to 700 units worldwide.",
  "lore": "The M4 GTS introduced water injection to the automotive world — spraying a fine mist into the intake to cool the charge air and allow more aggressive timing. The result is 493 horsepower from a 3.0-liter inline-six, which BMW paired with a stripped interior, OLED taillights, and an adjustable carbon fiber wing. It's the most extreme road car BMW has ever built.",
