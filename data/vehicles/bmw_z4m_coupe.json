  "description": "The clown shoe. Love it or hate the shape, the Z4 M Coupe packs the legendary S54 inline-six into a stiff coupe body with a short wheelbase and rear-wheel drive. It's twitchy, demanding, and absolutely alive in a way that makes modern BMWs feel like appliances.",

The S54 screams to 8000 RPM, the rear end steps out with zero warning, and the smile never leaves your face.",
