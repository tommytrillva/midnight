  "description": "650 horsepower from a supercharged LT4 in a chassis that can actually use it. The sixth-gen ZL1 finally gave the Camaro the handling to match its power — magnetic ride dampers, an electronic limited-slip differential, and enough downforce to make it a genuine track car disguised as a muscle car.",
  "lore": "For decades, the Camaro was the car you bought when you wanted straight-line speed and didn't care about corners. The ZL1 changed that. The LT4 supercharged V8 makes 650 horsepower, but it's the chassis that shocked the world — lapping the N\u00fcrburgring faster than a Porsche 911 Carrera S. American muscle learned to turn.",
