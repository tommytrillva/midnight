  "description": "The LS6-powered lightweight that taught European exotics a lesson in value. The C5 Z06 stripped weight everywhere — thinner glass, titanium exhaust, lighter wheels — and bolted in a 405 horsepower small-block V8 that redlines at 6500 RPM. The result embarrassed cars costing three times as much.",
