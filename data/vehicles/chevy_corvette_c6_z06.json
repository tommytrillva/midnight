  "description": "LS7 naturally aspirated. Seven liters of displacement, no forced induction, and 505 horsepower that arrives with the subtlety of a freight train. The C6 Z06 proved that cubic inches and aluminum construction could beat European exotics at their own game — on the track, not just the drag strip.",
  "lore": "The LS7 is the largest displacement small-block V8 GM ever built for a production car. Hand-assembled in a clean room, with titanium connecting rods and CNC-ported heads, it makes 505 horsepower without a single turbocharger or supercharger. The C6 Z06's aluminum frame weighs less than an E46 M3. Chevrolet engineers didn't just want to compete with the Europeans — they wanted to humiliate them.",
