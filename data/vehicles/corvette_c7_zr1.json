  "description": "755 horsepower from a supercharged American V8, mounted in a car that costs less than half the price of the European exotics it destroys. The C7 ZR1 is the last front-engine Corvette, and Chevrolet made damn sure it went out with a bang.",
  "lore": "The LT5 is a 6.2-liter supercharged V8 that produces 755 horsepower — the most powerful engine Chevrolet has ever put in a production car. The massive wing generates 950 pounds of downforce. It set a lap record at VIR that stood for years. The C7 ZR1 is proof that you don't need a prancing horse badge to build a world-class supercar.",
