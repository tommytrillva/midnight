  "description": "A matte black coupe that Diesel built with his own hands over seven years. Every weld, every bolt, every line of the custom ECU tune — all Diesel. The twin-turbo V8 makes 550 horsepower, but the car's real power is the story behind it. This is what obsession looks like.",

  "lore": "Diesel started building this car in a rented garage when he was nineteen. The body is a modified Liberty chassis, but everything underneath is custom — hand-fabricated headers, a bespoke twin-turbo setup, and a custom ECU that Diesel programmed himself. Seven years of late nights, bloody knuckles, and empty bank accounts. It's not just a car. It's Diesel's autobiography written in steel."
