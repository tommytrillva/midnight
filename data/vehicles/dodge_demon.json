  "description": "840 horsepower from the factory. Comes with a crate of drag racing tools. Dodge literally built a street-legal quarter-mile weapon.",
  "lore": "The Demon was banned from NHRA competition for being too fast — it runs the quarter mile in 9.65 seconds on street tires, making it the first production car to pull a wheelie off the line. Dodge ships it with a crate containing skinny front runner wheels, a floor jack, and tools for converting it to full drag spec. The passenger seat is deleted to save weight. This is not a car for Sunday drives.",
