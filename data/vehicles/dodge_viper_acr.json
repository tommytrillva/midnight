  "description": "Aero monster. The ACR took the already unhinged Viper and gave it a purpose beyond terrifying its owner. A massive wing, aggressive splitter, and race-spec suspension transformed America's most dangerous sports car into a legitimate track weapon that held lap records at circuits across the country.",
  "lore": "The original Viper was a car that actively tried to kill you. The ACR was a car that let you survive long enough to set a lap record. The 8.4-liter V10 makes 600 horsepower with no electronic assists — no traction control, no stability management, just you and ten cylinders of American fury. It set track records at Laguna Seca, Virginia International Raceway, and a dozen other circuits. It was proof that sometimes the brute force approach works.",
