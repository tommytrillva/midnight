  "description": "The sound alone is worth the price. The last of the naturally aspirated V8 Ferraris — a species going extinct.",
  "lore": "When Ferrari announced the 458's replacement would be turbocharged, collectors wept and prices skyrocketed. The 4.5-liter V8 revs to 9,000 RPM with a sound that makes grown men emotional. It's mid-engined, perfectly balanced, and represents the absolute peak of what a naturally aspirated Ferrari V8 can be. They will never make another one like it.",
