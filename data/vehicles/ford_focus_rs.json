  "description": "Drift mode included. Ford's engineers in Cologne built a hot hatchback with a party trick — a torque-vectoring AWD system that can send the majority of power to the rear wheels and let the tail slide on command. A turbo EcoBoost four and aggressive suspension make it a genuine rally car for the road.",
  "lore": "The Focus RS was developed at Ford's performance center in Cologne, Germany, by engineers who grew up watching Group B rally cars. The 2.3-liter EcoBoost four-cylinder is the same block found in the Mustang, retuned for boost and mated to a GKN twin-clutch rear differential that enables the infamous Drift Mode. Ford's lawyers tried to kill the feature. The engineers won. It's the most fun you can have in a hatchback with the traction control doing exactly what you tell it to.",
