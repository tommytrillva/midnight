  "description": "Le Mans heritage in carbon fiber form. Ford built the GT to win at Le Mans, and it did — then they made a street version so the rest of us could pretend. A twin-turbo V6 in a car that weighs nothing, shaped by a wind tunnel and driven by revenge.",
  "lore": "Ford built the GT for one reason: to go back to Le Mans and beat Ferrari again, fifty years after the original GT40 did it in 1966. Mission accomplished. The road car uses a 3.5-liter twin-turbo EcoBoost V6 that produces 647 horsepower, mounted in a carbon fiber monocoque that weighs just 3,000 pounds. The flying buttress rear design isn't just beautiful — it's functional aerodynamics. You needed an application to buy one, and Ford rejected most people.",
