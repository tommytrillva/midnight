  "description": "The Terminator. Ford's SVT division strapped an Eaton supercharger to a forged 4.6L V8 and dropped it into a Mustang with independent rear suspension. The result was 390 horsepower that the chassis could barely contain — and a drag strip reputation that full-price exotics learned to respect.",

  "lore": "They called it the Terminator because it killed everything at the drag strip. A simple pulley swap and tune puts you over 500 horsepower, and the forged internals laugh at the abuse. In Nova Pacifica, Terminators are the great equalizer — cheap speed that doesn't care about your pedigree.",
