The Ghost's Machine exists at the edge of Nova Pacifica's mythology — a car that's been spotted but never caught, described but never photographed clearly.",

  "lore": "The Ghost has been racing the streets of Nova Pacifica for longer than anyone can remember. Some say it's been the same driver for twenty years. Others say 'The Ghost' is a title, passed down. The car is always different — or is it? Witnesses can never agree on the make, the model, even the color. All they agree on is this: it's fast. Faster than anything. And you never see it coming until it's already past you."
