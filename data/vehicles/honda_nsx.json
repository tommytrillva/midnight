  "description": "Senna helped develop it. Gordon Murray daily drove one. The NSX proved that a mid-engine supercar didn't need to be temperamental, unreliable, or terrifying to drive. Honda applied F1 engineering to a car you could take to the grocery store — and it embarrassed Ferraris on the way there.",
