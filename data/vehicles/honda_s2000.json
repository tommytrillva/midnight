  "description": "A 9000 RPM naturally aspirated screamer in a roadster chassis. The S2000's F20C is the highest specific-output naturally aspirated four-cylinder Honda ever built — 120 horsepower per liter without a single forced-induction shortcut. The power lives at the top, and it rewards those brave enough to chase it.",
