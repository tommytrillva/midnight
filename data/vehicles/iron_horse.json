  "description": "A big, loud, unapologetically American muscle coupe. The Iron Horse trades finesse for brute force — a naturally aspirated V8 makes 260 horsepower and an intoxicating rumble. It's heavy, it understeers, and it doesn't care. Point it at a straight line and hold on.",

  "lore": "Liberty's answer to the import scene is simple: more cylinders. The Iron Horse is a throwback to an era when displacement solved every problem. In Downtown's twisty streets it's a handful, but on Harbor Expressway straightaways, nothing in Tier 2 can touch it."
