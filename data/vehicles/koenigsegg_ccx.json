  "description": "Swedish precision. Built by a company that started in a barn and ended up building the fastest cars on the planet. The CCX is 806 horsepower of twin-supercharged fury, wrapped in a carbon fiber body that weighs less than a Toyota Camry.",
  "lore": "Christian von Koenigsegg started building cars in a rented hangar at a former Swedish Air Force base. The CCX — Competition Coupe X, celebrating the company's 10th anniversary — was designed to meet US crash regulations without compromising performance. The 4.7-liter twin-supercharged V8 produces 806 horsepower in a car that weighs just 2,600 pounds. Every CCX is hand-built, and Koenigsegg's total production across all models can be counted in the hundreds.",
