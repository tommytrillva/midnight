  "description": "The V12 monster. SVJ stands for Super Veloce Jota — the most extreme designation Lamborghini bestows. 770 horsepower from a naturally aspirated V12, all-wheel drive, active aerodynamics, and a design that looks like it was forged in a volcano. This is Lamborghini at maximum volume.",
  "lore": "The Aventador SVJ took the Nürburgring production car lap record with a time of 6:44.97 — a number that shouldn't be physically possible for a car that weighs 3,300 pounds and has a 6.5-liter V12 mounted lengthwise behind the cabin. The ALA 2.0 active aero system, four-wheel steering, and magneto-rheological suspension work together to make the impossible merely improbable. Limited to 900 units worldwide.",
