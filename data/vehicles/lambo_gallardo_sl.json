  "description": "The lightweight bull. Lamborghini stripped 220 pounds from the standard Gallardo, added carbon fiber everything, and let the 5.0-liter V10 breathe a little harder. The result is a rawer, more aggressive machine that feels like it's actively trying to escape from under you.",
  "lore": "Superleggera means 'super light' in Italian, and Lamborghini took it seriously. Carbon fiber body panels, lightweight wheels, stripped interior, and a diet that brought the V10 screamer down to 2,900 pounds. It's the Gallardo that hardcore drivers begged for — less luxury, more lunacy.",
