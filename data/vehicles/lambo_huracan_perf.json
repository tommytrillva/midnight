  "description": "The ALA active aero system makes the Performante a different animal from the standard Huracán. Active flaps in the front splitter and rear wing redirect airflow in real-time, creating asymmetric downforce through corners. It held the Nürburgring production car lap record. Enough said.",
  "lore": "ALA stands for Aerodinamica Lamborghini Attiva — Lamborghini's active aerodynamics system that can vector downforce to individual wheels by opening and closing flaps in the carbon fiber bodywork. Combined with a forged carbon fiber construction process that Lamborghini invented, the Performante weighs 220 pounds less than the standard Huracán while producing 40 more horsepower. The result set a 6:52.01 lap at the Nürburgring.",
