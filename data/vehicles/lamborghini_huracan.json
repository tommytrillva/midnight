  "description": "The V10 entry point into the Lamborghini universe. 602 horsepower, all-wheel drive, and a design language that looks like it was sketched by a fighter jet designer having a fever dream. Subtle it is not. Fast it absolutely is.",
  "lore": "The Huracán replaced the Gallardo as Lamborghini's 'entry-level' supercar — a phrase that only makes sense in a world where $350,000 is considered affordable. The 5.2-liter V10 screams with an intensity that makes neighbors file noise complaints, and the all-wheel-drive system means you can actually use all 602 horsepower without immediately dying.",
