  "description": "Yamaha V10 symphony. The LFA was Lexus proving it could build a supercar that rivaled anything from Italy or Germany — then going further by making it sound better than all of them. A 4.8-liter V10 that revs to 9,000 RPM, a carbon fiber reinforced polymer body, and a digital tachometer because the needle couldn't keep up with the engine.",
  "lore": "Yamaha tuned the V10. It revs to 9,000 RPM and sounds like an angel screaming. Lexus lost money on every one they built. They didn't care.",
