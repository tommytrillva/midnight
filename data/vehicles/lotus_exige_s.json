  "description": "Supercharged lightweight. Colin Chapman's philosophy of 'simplify, then add lightness' taken to its logical extreme. A supercharged Toyota V6 in a car that weighs less than a Miata. The Exige S doesn't need 600 horsepower because it doesn't carry 600 horsepower worth of weight.",
  "lore": "Lotus borrowed a V6 from Toyota, bolted on a supercharger, and dropped it into a car made primarily of aluminum and fiberglass that tips the scales at 2,400 pounds. The result is a power-to-weight ratio that embarrasses cars with twice the horsepower. There's no power steering, no sound deadening, and the cabin is roughly the size of a phone booth. None of that matters when you're carrying more lateral G through a corner than a GT3 car.",
