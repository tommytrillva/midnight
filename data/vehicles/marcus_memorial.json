  "lore": "Marcus was Diesel's best friend and the best driver anyone in the scene had ever seen. After the accident, Diesel spent two years tracking down every original part to restore Marcus's car to the exact way it was the last time they drove together. The white paint. The stock wheels. The cassette tape still in the deck. Diesel doesn't race this car. He just keeps it perfect. When he gives you the keys, it means something words can't express."
