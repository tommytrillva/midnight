  "description": "Maya Torres doesn't have money for a powerful engine, so she focused on everything else. Coilovers, sway bars, brakes, tires, weight reduction, alignment — her little hatchback has 200 horsepower but handles like it's on rails. This is what passion looks like on a budget.",

  "lore": "Maya built this car in her apartment complex's parking garage with hand tools and YouTube tutorials. She couldn't afford a turbo kit, so she made the chassis perfect instead. Every dollar went into suspension geometry, brake pads, and lightweight wheels. The result is a car that rich kids in expensive machines can't keep up with in the corners. Maya's Project isn't about money — it's about knowledge, patience, and the refusal to accept limitations."
