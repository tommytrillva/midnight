  "description": "The FC RX-7 is a rotary-powered sports car that screams to redline with a sound no piston engine can replicate. Lightweight, mid-front engine, and turbocharged from the factory. It's fast, it's unique, and it will teach you what 'apex seal replacement' means.",
  "lore": "Reliability optional. The rotary motor sounds like an angry wasp trapped in a tin can, and it drinks premix like a frat boy at a keg party. The turbo spools, the triangle spins, and for one glorious moment between rebuilds, it's the most exciting car on the street.",
