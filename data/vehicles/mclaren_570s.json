  "description": "Carbon core accessibility — if accessibility means a $320,000 supercar with a carbon fiber tub borrowed from a million-dollar hypercar program. The 570S is McLaren's entry point, and it's faster than most manufacturers' flagships.",
  "lore": "McLaren's 'Sports Series' was supposed to be the affordable option. It still has a carbon fiber monocoque chassis, a twin-turbo V8, dihedral doors, and performance that embarrasses cars costing twice as much. The 570S proves that McLaren doesn't know how to build a slow car — even when they're trying to build a cheap one.",
