  "description": "The Longtail ultimate. McLaren took the already-devastating 720S, added 45 horsepower, removed 176 pounds, extended the body, and created a track weapon so capable it makes professional racing drivers question their life choices.",
  "lore": "The Longtail designation traces back to the McLaren F1 GTR Longtail that dominated Le Mans in the late 1990s. The 765LT carries on that legacy with a lengthened carbon fiber body, titanium exhaust, carbon fiber racing seats, and a twin-turbo V8 tuned to 755 horsepower. McLaren removed the air conditioning, audio system, and carpet to save weight. If you want comfort, buy a 720S. If you want to set lap records, this is the one.",
