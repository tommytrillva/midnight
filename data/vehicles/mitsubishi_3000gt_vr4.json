  "description": "Twin turbo V6, all-wheel drive, all-wheel steering, active aero, and active exhaust — in 1991. The 3000GT VR-4 was the most technologically advanced Japanese sports car of its era, packed with so many systems that it weighed nearly two tons. Heavy, complex, and absolutely devastating when everything works.",

  "lore": "The VR-4 is what happens when engineers are given unlimited budgets and zero weight targets. Every system is brilliant individually. Together, they create a car that weighs as much as a small apartment but puts down power like a freight train with a grudge. Maintenance is a nightmare. Worth it.",
