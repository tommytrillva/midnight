  "description": "Nikko's signature car, tuned with the same precision he applies to everything. The 350Z is perfectly balanced — not the fastest, not the flashiest, but every modification was chosen with intention. The car reflects its driver: measured, calculated, and always in control.",

  "lore": "Nikko doesn't chase horsepower numbers. He chases lap times. His 350Z has been methodically tuned over two years — every modification tested, data-logged, and either kept or removed based on results. The car isn't about ego or style; it's about being faster around a circuit by two-tenths of a second at a time. It's Nikko in automotive form: quiet, precise, and annoyingly fast."
