  "description": "VQ power, drift potential, and the spiritual successor to the Z-car legacy. The 350Z brought Nissan's sports car lineage back from the dead with a 287 horsepower V6, rear-wheel drive, and a chassis that's equally happy on a circuit or sideways through a corner. This is Nikko's platform of choice — and he chose wisely.",

  "lore": "Nikko's car. He picked the 350Z not because it was the fastest or the most exotic, but because it was honest. A naturally aspirated V6 with a predictable chassis — no turbo lag to mask, no electronic wizardry to lean on. Just driver and machine, communicating clearly. That's Nikko's whole philosophy in automotive form.",
