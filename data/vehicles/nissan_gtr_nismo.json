  "description": "The ultimate R35. Nismo took Nissan's already legendary GT-R and turned every dial to eleven. Hand-assembled engine, carbon fiber body panels, competition suspension, and the most advanced all-wheel-drive system ever fitted to a Japanese car.",
  "lore": "The VR38DETT is hand-assembled by a single technician — a 'Takumi' master craftsman whose name is stamped on a plaque on the engine. The Nismo variant gets exclusive turbos from the GT3 racing program, a retuned ATTESA all-wheel-drive system, and enough carbon fiber to build a small airplane. It's the final evolution of Godzilla.",
