  "description": "Godzilla evolved. The R35 GT-R abandoned the Skyline name and the RB engine, replacing them with a bespoke twin-turbo V6 and a dual-clutch gearbox that launches the car to 60 mph in under three seconds. It embarrassed supercars costing five times as much and never stopped improving.",
  "lore": "When the R35 debuted, it set a 7:29 lap at the N\u00fcrburgring and the supercar establishment panicked. A Japanese car with a V6 had no business being that fast. But the VR38DETT is hand-assembled by Takumi master craftsmen, and the ATTESA E-TS AWD system can split torque a thousand times per second. Technology as philosophy.",
