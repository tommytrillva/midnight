  "description": "The final evolution of the Skyline GT-R lineage. The V-Spec II N\u00fcr was Nissan's send-off for the RB26 — a hand-built engine in a chassis refined by decades of Group A racing. Only 750 were made, and every single one became a holy relic of JDM culture.",
  "lore": "N\u00fcr stands for N\u00fcrburgring, where Nissan tested and tuned the R34 to perfection. The V-Spec II got an N1-spec engine block with improved oiling, gold valve covers, and a suspension setup that made the car feel telepathic on circuit. The Japanese government rated it at 280 horsepower — nobody believed them. Dyno sheets told a different story.",
