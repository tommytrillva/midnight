  "lore": "Nova Motors built twelve hypercars as a technology demonstrator and sold each one for nearly a million dollars. The hybrid powertrain combines a twin-turbo V8 with three electric motors, producing 900 horsepower and instant torque. Active aerodynamics adjust the car's downforce profile in real-time. It's not a car — it's a spaceship that happens to have wheels."
