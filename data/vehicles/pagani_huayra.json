  "description": "Art meets speed. Horacio Pagani doesn't build cars — he builds sculptures that happen to do 230 mph. The Huayra is named after the Incan god of wind, and its AMG-sourced twin-turbo V12 produces a sound worthy of divine attention.",
  "lore": "Every Huayra is a masterpiece of obsessive craftsmanship. The carbon fiber weave is exposed and treated like fine art. The titanium exhaust bolts are polished to a mirror finish. The interior uses leather, aluminum, and carbon fiber arranged with the precision of a Swiss watch. And underneath all that artistry sits a Mercedes-AMG 6.0-liter twin-turbo V12 producing 730 horsepower. Horacio Pagani was once told by Enzo Ferrari that an Argentinian could never build a great car. The Huayra is his answer. Only 100 were built.",
