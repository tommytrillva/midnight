  "description": "The WS6 Trans Am is the Camaro Z28's wilder, meaner sibling. Same LS1, but with ram air induction, aggressive aero, and a functional hood scoop that force-feeds cold air to 320 horsepower. It's the last of the real Firebirds, and it goes out swinging.",
  "lore": "LS1, WS6, legend. Pontiac is dead and the Firebird died with it, but the WS6 Trans Am remains the greatest car they ever built. Ram air hood scoops, compound-curved headlights that look like they're angry at traffic, and an LS1 that runs 12s with bolt-ons. The last muscle car Pontiac ever made was also their best.",
