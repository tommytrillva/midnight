  "description": "The track weapon. The 997 GT3 took the Mezger formula and refined every single variable. More displacement, more power, sharper aero, and a chassis so balanced it makes you believe you're a better driver than you actually are. The last analog GT3 before electronics took over.",
  "lore": "Porsche engineers called the 997 GT3 the most complete car they'd ever built. The 3.8-liter Mezger flat-six makes 435 horsepower with no turbochargers, no superchargers, and no apologies. It revs to 8,500 RPM with a flat-six howl that echoes off canyon walls. This is what driving was supposed to feel like.",
