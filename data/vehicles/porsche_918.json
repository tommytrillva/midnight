  "description": "The hybrid pioneer. Before anyone else figured out how to make electrification exciting, Porsche combined a screaming V8 with two electric motors and produced 887 horsepower of all-wheel-drive fury. The 918 proved that the future of performance doesn't have to be boring.",
  "lore": "Porsche's holy trinity entry — alongside the LaFerrari and McLaren P1 — proved that hybrid technology could enhance rather than dilute the driving experience. The 4.6-liter V8 revs to 9,150 RPM with a flat-plane crank sound that's pure motorsport, while the electric motors fill in torque gaps and enable silent electric-only driving. It set a 6:57 lap at the Nürburgring on its way to redefining what a hypercar could be. Only 918 were built.",
