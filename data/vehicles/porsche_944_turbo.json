  "description": "Transaxle balance in a package that Porsche purists once dismissed and now desperately seek. The 944 Turbo's front-engine, rear-transaxle layout delivers 50:50 weight distribution that makes the 911's rear-engine pendulum feel archaic. The turbo 2.5 four-cylinder punches above its weight class.",

  "lore": "For decades, the 944 was the Porsche you bought when you couldn't afford a 911. Now the 911 crowd is buying 944 Turbos because they realized what the engineers knew all along — the transaxle cars are better balanced. Funny how that works.",
