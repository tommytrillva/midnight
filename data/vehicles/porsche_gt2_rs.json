  "description": "The widow maker returns. 700 horsepower through the rear wheels only, because Porsche engineers apparently have a death wish and want you to share it. The GT2 RS is the most powerful 911 ever built — a twin-turbo flat-six monster that rewards precision and punishes overconfidence.",
  "lore": "They call it the widow maker for a reason. The original 993 GT2 earned the name by sending overconfident drivers into barriers at triple-digit speeds. The 991 GT2 RS carries on that tradition with 700 horsepower, rear-wheel drive, and a turbocharged flat-six that hits like a freight train. Respect it, and it'll make you look like a god. Disrespect it, and it'll put you in the wall.",
