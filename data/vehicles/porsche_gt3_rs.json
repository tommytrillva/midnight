  "description": "Naturally aspirated perfection. While the rest of the world chases turbo lag and boost curves, the GT3 RS screams to 9,000 RPM with a 4.0-liter flat-six that responds to throttle input like it's reading your mind. Pure, analog, and utterly magnificent.",
  "lore": "In an era of forced induction and hybrid complexity, Porsche built a car that does one thing better than anything else on the planet: turn a racetrack into a personal playground. The GT3 RS is a street-legal race car with a naturally aspirated engine that revs to the heavens and a chassis tuned by people who've spent their lives at the Nürburgring.",
