  "description": "A well-maintained classic that Preston bet — and lost — in a pink slip race. This 911 is a proper driver's car: naturally aspirated flat-six, rear-engine, manual transmission, no electronic nannies. Preston kept it in perfect condition, which makes losing it sting even more.",

  "lore": "Preston's 911 was his pride and joy — a Weissach classic he bought with trust fund money and actually learned to drive properly. He put it on the line in a pink slip race because he was that confident. That confidence was misplaced. Now it's yours, and every time you drive it, you can feel the ghost of Preston's ego riding shotgun."
