  "description": "An outrageously modified American muscle car that belongs to the underground queen herself. The supercharged V8 makes 600 horsepower, the paint is custom metallic purple, and the interior is white leather with gold accents. Subtlety is for people who haven't earned the right to be loud.",

  "lore": "The underground queen of Nova Pacifica doesn't do subtle. Her Chariot is a statement — custom metallic purple paint that cost more than most people's cars, a supercharged V8 that announces her arrival from three blocks away, and an interior that would make a rapper blush. She built her empire from nothing, and this car is the throne she sits on. When the Queen's Chariot shows up at a race, everyone knows the stakes just went up."
