  "description": "A scrappy little hatchback with more rust than paint. The Fox body is featherweight and rear-wheel drive — a combination that makes it a surprisingly capable drift car in the right hands. Most of these ended up in junkyards, but the survivors have a cult following.",

  "lore": "The Kitsune Fox was supposed to be a forgettable economy car, but its rear-drive layout and featherweight chassis made it an accidental legend in grassroots drift scenes. In Nova Pacifica, you can find them in every junkyard — and on every touge run at 2 AM."
