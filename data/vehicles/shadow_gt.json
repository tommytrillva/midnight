  "description": "A rear-engine GT that demands respect. The Shadow GT's flat-six howls behind the rear axle, and that unusual layout means the car is always trying to swap ends. Master it, and nothing else on the road can touch you through corners. Fail, and you're in the wall.",

  "lore": "The Shadow GT is a contradiction — a car that's been fundamentally wrong from an engineering standpoint for decades, yet remains one of the fastest things on any road. The rear-engine layout is treacherous for the uninitiated, but those who learn to dance with the pendulum effect find a partner that rewards bravery like nothing else."
