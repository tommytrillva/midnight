  "lore": "Kreuzer's philosophy is simple: why choose between comfort and speed when you can have both? The Storm AWD will cruise at highway speeds in perfect silence, then annihilate a straightaway at the tap of a pedal. It's the car that corporate executives use to quietly humiliate sports car owners at every stoplight."
