  "description": "Limited American special. The S209 was the first S-line STI ever sold in North America — 209 units of hand-tuned flat-four fury. STI's motorsport division touched every component: forged pistons, larger turbo, intercooler water spray, and Bilstein dampers calibrated on Subaru's test track in Japan.",
  "lore": "Subaru Tecnica International built only 209 units for the US market. Each EJ25 was hand-assembled with forged internals, a larger HKS turbocharger, and an intercooler water spray system borrowed from rally cars. The boxer rumble at idle is deceptive — it sounds docile until boost builds and the symmetrical AWD system hooks up with a ferocity that explains why Subaru dominates rally stages worldwide. The S209 was the EJ25's swan song, and STI made sure it sang.",
