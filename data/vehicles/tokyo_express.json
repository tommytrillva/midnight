  "lore": "When Zenith's engineers set out to build the Tokyo Express, they started with a clean sheet of paper and a single goal: build the best naturally aspirated sports car ever made. The V10 engine was developed with Formula 1 technology, and the exhaust note at 9,000 RPM is something that changes people. You hear it once, and nothing else sounds right ever again."
