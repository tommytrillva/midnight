  "description": "The return. After two decades without a Supra, Toyota brought back the nameplate with a BMW-sourced inline-six and a chassis co-developed with the Z4. Purists argued about the engine. Drivers who actually got behind the wheel stopped arguing and started smiling.",
  "lore": "The A90 Supra's BMW B58 engine was controversial from the moment it was announced. Toyota fans wanted a 2JZ successor. What they got was a turbocharged inline-six that responds to tuning like it was born for it — bolt-on modifications pushing well past 500 horsepower on stock internals. History has a funny way of repeating itself. The original Supra wasn't appreciated in its time either.",
