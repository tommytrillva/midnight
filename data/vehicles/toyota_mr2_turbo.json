  "description": "The SW20 MR2 Turbo is Toyota's mid-engine weapon. The 3S-GTE sits behind the driver, feeding the rear wheels with turbocharged fury. It's fast, it's balanced on entry, and it will swap ends on you mid-corner if you lift the throttle. Respect the snap oversteer or pay the price.",
  "lore": "Mid-engine snap oversteer. The car that insurance companies hate and driving purists love. A turbo four behind your head, the rear wheels directly connected to the motor, and handling characteristics that separate the skilled from the scared. Lift off in a corner and the rear comes around like it has a personal grudge.",
