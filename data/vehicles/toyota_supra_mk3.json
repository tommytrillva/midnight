  "description": "Living in the shadow of its younger brother, the Mk3 Supra is the underrated classic that purists quietly hoard. The 7M-GTE makes real turbo power, the chassis is grand-tourer stiff, and the price is a fraction of what the Mk4 commands.",
  "lore": "Underrated classic. Everyone wants the Mk4, but the Mk3 was making boost before boost was cool. The 7M has a reputation for head gasket failure, but the previous owner did the ARP stud fix. Probably. The receipt is around here somewhere.",
