  "description": "Zero's personal machine. Nobody knows where it came from. No VIN, no registration, no manufacturer markings. The hybrid powertrain produces 700 horsepower with surgical precision, and the car moves through traffic like a ghost through walls. It shouldn't exist, but it does.",

  "lore": "The Zero Prototype has no history. No paper trail. The engine block has no casting marks, the chassis uses alloys that don't match any known manufacturer's spec sheet. Zero appeared in Nova Pacifica's underground scene driving this car three years ago, and nobody has been able to identify it since. Some say it's a stolen concept car. Others say it was built from scratch. Zero isn't talking."
